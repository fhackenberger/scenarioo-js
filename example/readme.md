# Example

This example shows how to use scenarioo-js in a protractor (webdriverJS) environment.


example/app contains a very simple angularJS application.
Run 'runExample.sh' in order to start a http server that serves the angularJS application and trigger protractor e2e tests.
Afterwards you'll find the generated scenarioo documentation in /scenariodocu.

Don't be alarmed, the second e2e test will fail (in order to have a failing run in scenario documentation).
